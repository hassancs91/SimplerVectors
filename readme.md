# SimplerVectors

SimplerVectors is a straightforward, beginner-friendly vector database project designed for efficiently handling and querying large-scale high-dimensional data vectors. This project is especially suited for applications like language models in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) projects. Currently in its early stages, VectorDB aims to achieve high performance and scalability, making it ideal for managing very large datasets.

## Features

- **Efficient Storage**: Leverages NumPy's memory-mapped files to manage large datasets efficiently.
- **Simple Design**: The system is designed to be easy to understand and use, even for developers new to vector databases.
- **Vector Normalization and Search**: Supports automatic vector normalization and cosine similarity searches to find the top similar vectors.
- **Scalability in Development**: Focuses on enhancements for handling growing data volumes and increasing query demands as development progresses.
